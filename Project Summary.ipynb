    "The given data of employees has 1200 data to perform a higher level machine learning where it is well structured. The features present in the data are 28 in total. The shape of the data is 1200 x 28. The 28 features are classified into quantitative and qualitative where 16 features are qualitative and 11 features are quantitave. The Employee ID data is alpha-numerical data which doesn't play a role as a relevant feature for Performance Rating.\n",

The important aspects of the data are depending on the correlation of data between features and Performance Rating.

    "The machine learning model which is used in this project is Random Forest classifier and Gradient Boosted Classifier which pedicted the nearby higher accuracy of 92%. Since it is categorical labelled data, it has to go through the classifier machine learning techniques which will be suitable for this structured data. The numerical features are the most relevant in the model according to correlation technique.\n",
